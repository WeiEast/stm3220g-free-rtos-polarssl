@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC3 and TIM2 to convert continuously data 
from ADC3 with channel ADC_CHANNEL_7.

Each time an external trigger is generated by TIM2 a new conversion is started by ADC3.

At the end of conversion, an interrupt is generated and the converted data of 
ADC3 DR register is affected to the uhADCxConvertedValue variable in the ADC 
conversion complete call back function (HAL_ADC_ConvCpltCallback).

The timer is used to trigger an ADC measure at 20 KHz.

Configuration of the timer to trig an ADC measure at 20 Khz:
	From the reference manual, Reset and Clock control part, Timer 2 is clocked on PCLK1.
	The function SystemClock_Config() configures the clock divider as follow:
	1) The system clock is 120MHz.
	2) AHB  Prescaler = 1 => AHB clock is 120 MHz.
	3) APB1 Prescaler = 4 => APB1 clock is 30 MHz.
	4) For Timer 2, as APB1 Prescaler = 4, Timer 2 Clock is APB1 clock X 2 = 60 Mhz.

	For a 20 Khz frequency, we need 60 MHz / 20 KHz = 3000 clock cycle.
	So, in TIM_Config function, we set the following period: htim.Init.Period = 3000;

The voltage on pin PF.09 (ADC3 channel 7)can vary using the board potentiometer RV1.

Remark: LED3 is ON when there is an error in initialization.
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F2xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL RevC evaluation board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
  
  - STM322xG-EVAL RevC Set-up
    - Use the Potentiometer (RV1) of the Eval board (connected to PF.10).


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
